# Mock-up

Coding challenge requiring a render of a designed psd file into code.
Goal was for clean / modular / re-usable CSS, no frameworks allowed,
but preprocessors allowed. SASS preprocessor was used for modularity with partials
enabling a clean main style file along with reusability/scalability for future.

Names and visual mockups anonymized.
