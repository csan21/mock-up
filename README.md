# Mock-up

Coding challenge requiring a mock-up render of a designed psd file into code.
Goal was for clean / modular / re-usable CSS, no frameworks permitted,
but preprocessors allowed. SASS preprocessor was used for CSS modularity with partials
enabling a clean main style file along with reusability/scalability for future.

All text, names, & visual mockups anonymized.
